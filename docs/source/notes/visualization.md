# View Your Model More Clearly

When OpenDelta makes modifications to a pretrained model (PTM), it is beneficial to know what your PTM looks like, especially the location of the parameters.

Before making modifications, you can know how to specify your modifications in terms of key addressing.

Once the modification is done, you can know if your modification is what you expected, for example,
whether the position of the delta modules are desired, or whether you froze the correct parameters.
